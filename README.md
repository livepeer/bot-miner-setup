# bot-miner-setup

setup instructions for side-by-side GPU mining and transcoding w/ LivePeer

As time goes on, alternative installation options will be added, but for now, this document is based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

Go through the following installation steps, in order:

* [install cuda drivers](ubuntu/install-cuda.md)

* [cuda ffmpeg setup](ubuntu/cuda-ffmpeg-setup.md)

* [cuda livepeer setup](ubuntu/cuda-livepeer-setup.md)

* [ethminer systemd setup](ubuntu/ethminer-systemd-setup.md)

After following the [ethminer systemd setup](ubuntu/ethminer-systemd-setup.md) instructions, your GPUs will be mining Ethereum as a systemd service.

We can run the transcoding service in offline mode using one of two ways:

* [local testnet using the devtool](testnet-devtool.md)

or

* [offline b/o/t mode](offline_b_o_t.md)
* [offline b/ot mode](offline_b_ot.md)

For a better idea of how things will behave on the network, we can run the service on the Rinkeby testnet:

* [Rinkeby testnet b/o/t mode](testnet-rinkeby-b_o_t.md)
* [Rinkeby testnet b/ot mode](testnet-rinkeby-b_ot.md)

* To run these services via systemd, follow [these instructions](systemd/README.md) to create systemd services.

As an alternative to the manual installation steps described above, the Livepeer B/O/T network can be installed using `docker-compose`:

* [docker-compose setup: b/o/t offchain](ubuntu/cuda-docker-compose-setup-b_o_t-offchain)
* [docker-compose setup: b/ot offchain](ubuntu/cuda-docker-compose-setup-b_ot-offchain)
* [docker-compose setup: b/o/t rinkeby testnet](ubuntu/cuda-docker-compose-setup-b_o_t-rinkeby)
* [docker-compose setup: b/ot rinkeby testnet](ubuntu/cuda-docker-compose-setup-b_ot-rinkeby)
